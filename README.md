# SAGE-RWKV
The official implementation of 《Stable Input, Stable Operator: Structure-Aligned RWKV-based Framework for Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation》

The core part of SAGE-RWKV's code is providedin [here](https://github.com/orange-czh/SAGE-RWKV/blob/main/core_RWKV-based_segmenatation_network.py). By using this file and the original RWKV-UNet as a backbone, you can easily incorporate our code into your tasks. 

The complete part of our code will be released after the paper is accepted.

## Acknowledgments
